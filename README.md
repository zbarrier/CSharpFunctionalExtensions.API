Functional Extensions for C# APIs
======================================================
This library is an opinated version of the CSharpFunctionalExtensions for APIs.

This library helps write code in more functional way for APIs. To get to know more about the principles behind the orginal CSharpFunctionalExtensions which this is based off of, check out the [Applying Functional Principles in C# Pluralsight course](https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/ps-func).

## Installation

Available on [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CSharpFunctionalExtensions.API/)

	PM> Install-Package CSharpFunctionalExtensions.API

## Testing

For extension methods on top of this library's `Result` and `Maybe` that you can use in tests, see [this nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FluentAssertions.CSharpFunctionalExtensions/) (GitHub link: https://github.com/pedromtcosta/FluentAssertions.CSharpFunctionalExtensions).
